      <p className='description'>Been from a Venezuelan origin and in France for more than three years, I was able to discover a whole new country and acquire a dual culture. My experiences have brought me great personal enrichment and have led me to be much more autonomous and independent.
          <br/><br/>I am a Master Design Student. I am interested in editorial, fashion, visual identity, and typography and would like to collaborate with photographers. I seek to explore new ways of pushing boundaries, always looking for the new, the daring, to create something iconic, unique, special.
